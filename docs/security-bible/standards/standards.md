## General Practices

### Essential Eight by The Australian Cyber Security Center:
1. Application whitelisting - Whitelist approved and trusted programs to prevent the execution of unapproved or malicious programs from executing.
2. Patching applications - Perform regular patching/updating of applications in your network.
3. Office macros - Configure Microsoft Office products to block the execution of un-trusted macros.
4. Harden user applications - Tightly control applications that have the ability to perform unwanted or potentially vulnerable actions.
5. Restrict administrative privileges - Restrict administrative privilege for operating systems and applications based on user duties.
6. Patch operating systems – Routinely patch and upgrade your operating systems to the latest versions.
7. Use multi-factor authentication - Set up multi-factor authentication to provide higher authentication assurance for privileged, power and remote user access.
8. Backup daily – Create regular backups of your most important data and configuration settings to help you recover quickly from a disruption. Keep backups on a device that is not connected to your network.
