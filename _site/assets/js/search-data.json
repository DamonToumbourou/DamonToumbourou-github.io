SANS Incident Response Plan . | Preparation review and codify an organizational security policy, perform a risk assessment, identify sensitive assets, define which are critical security incidents the team should focus on, and build a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). | Identification monitor IT systems and detect deviations from normal operations, and see if they represent actual security incidents. When an incident is discovered, collect additional evidence, establish its type and severity, and document everything. | Containment perform short-term containment, for example by isolating the network segment that is under attack. Then focus on long-term containment, which involves temporary fixes to allow systems to be used in production, while rebuilding clean systems. | Eradication remove malware from all affected systems, identify the root cause of the attack, and take action to prevent similar attacks in the future. | Recovery bring affected production systems back online carefully, to prevent additional attacks. Test, verify and monitor affected systems to ensure they are back to normal activity. | Lessons learned—no later than two weeks from the end of the incident, perform a retrospective of the incident. Prepare complete documentation of the incident, investigate the incident further, understand what was done to contain it and whether anything in the incident response process could be improved. | .

    "content": "ASN . An autonomous system (AS) is a very large network or group of networks with a single routing policy. Each AS is assigned a unique ASN, which is a number that identifies the AS. An AS routing policy is a list of the IP address that the AS controls, plus a list of the other ASes to which it connects. The ASN (Autonomous System Number) are unique numbers that are only required for external communications with inter-network routers. BGP . ASes announce their routing policy to other ASers and routers vai the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP is the protocol for routing data packets between ASes. Without the routing information, operating the internet on a large scale would be impractical, as data packets would get lost or take too long. Each AS uses BGP to announce which IP address they are responsible for and which ASes the connect to. BGP routers take all the information from ASes around the world and put it into databases called routing tables to determine fastest paths from AS to AS. When packets arrive, BGP routers refer to their routing tables to determine which AS the packet should go to next. With so many ASes in the world, BGP routers are constantly updating their routing tables. As networks go offline, new networks come online, and ASes expand or contract their IP address space, all of this information has to be announced via BGP so that BGP routers can adjust their routing tables. DMZ . The term DMZ known as Demilitarized zone, is a type of network where you deploy all your public internet-facing servers. It could be a web server, mail server, FTP server, etc. It is similar to the LAN network, but there are some differences. While in the LAN network, most of the traffic will be outbound, meaning the users will initiate the traffic out to the internet and come back. In DMZ, however, most of the traffic will be inbound. You open a certain port, for example, http/HTTPS, for your web server, and anybody on the internet will be able to reach your web server inside the DMZ. We can also deploy a web server on the LAN side and allow external users to access the webserver from the internet, But that’s not a good security practice. If your web server on the LAN got compromised, your entire LAN side of the network would be affected. For any public-facing traffic, it is recommended to keep them on an isolated network such as DMZ instead on the LAN. IPSec . secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network. It is used in virtual private networks (VPNs). ",

Image: %Systemroot%\\System32\\ntoskrnl.exe (Task Manager / Process Hacker) and None (Process Explorer) # ntoskrnl.exe Windows NT operating system kernel executable. Acts as the central module (kernel) of the Windows OS. # smss.exe Sessions manager process is the first user mode process. It’s responsible for creating the list of the environment variables, the security descriptors that’ll be used by the various system resources, initializing the rest of the registry (HKLM Software and the SAM and security hives) and a lot more. - The system process creates the first SMSS instance and its known as the master SMSS.EXE process. It’s the only instance of SMSS.EXE that’ll stay after windows has booted up and one of the characteristics of this process is that it doesn’t have any command line arguments. - The master SMSS process will create at least two instances of itself. One in “Session 0” (OS) that will be responsible for creating the “wininit.exe” process and another in “Session 1” (User) that’ll represent the first logged-on user and will create the “winlogon.exe”. Both will spawn a “csrss.exe” process. - All the children SMSS.EXE processes created by the master SMSS.EXE process will exit after finishing their JOB. # Wininit.exe Windows initialization process is responsible for initializing and setting a lot of things. - It sets the default environment variables (USERPROFILE, ALLUSERPROFILE, PUBLIC and ProgramData). - It creates the LSASS process and sets the LSA encryption key. - It creates the Services Control manager by launching the SERVICES.EXE process - It creates the temp directory in the system root (%Systemroot%\\Temp). # regsvr32.exe Is a command-line utility to register and unregister OLE controls, such as DLLs and ActiveX controls in the Windows Registry. Regsvr32.exe is installed in the %systemroot%\\System32 folder in Windows XP and later versions of Windows. Usage: $ Regsvr32 [/u] [/n] [/i[:cmdline]] &lt;dllname&gt; - /u - Unregister server - /i - Call DllInstall passing it an optional [cmdline]; when it is used with /u, it calls dll uninstall - /n - do not call DllRegisterServer; this option must be used with /i - /s – Silent; display no message boxes # rundll32.exe Loads and runs 32bit dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). There are no configurable settings for Rundll32. Windows Evidence of File and Folder Opening . # Open/Save MRU Registry key tracks files that have been opened or saved within a Windows shell dialog box including web browsers and most applications. Interpretation: - The “*” key – This subkey tracks the most recent files of any extension input in an OpenSave dialog - .??? (Three letter extension) – This subkey stores file info from the OpenSave dialog by specific extension Location (Win7+): NTUSER.DAT\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\ComDlg32\\ OpenSavePIDlMRU # Last-Visit MRU Tracks exe used by application to open files documented in Open/Save MRU the dir location for the last file that was accessed by that app. Interpretation: We get two important pieces of information from this key - applications executed by the user - and the last place in the file system that those applications interacted with. - Interesting and hidden directories are often identified via this registry key. Location (win7+): NTUSER.DAT\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\ComDlg32\\LastVisitedPidlMRU # Recent Files Registry key tracks the last files and folders opened and is used to populate data in ‘recent’ menus. Intepretation: RecentDocs: Tracks overall order of the last 150 files or folders opened.???: These subkeys store the last 20 files opened by the user of each extension type. MRU list tracks the temporal order in which each file was opened. The most recently used (MRU) item is associated with the last write time of the key, providing one timestamp of file opening for each file extension type. Folder: This subkey stores the last 30 folders opened by the user. The most recently used (MRU) item in this key is associated with the last write time of the key, providing the time of opening for that folde Location: NTUSER.DAT\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\RecentDocs # Jump Lists Allows users to access frequently used items. Data stored in AutomaticDestinations folder will each have a unique file prepended with the AppID of the association application and embedded with LNK files in each stream. Interpretation: - Each jump list file is named according to an application identifier (AppID). List of Jump List IDs -&gt; https://dfir.to/EZJumpList - Each Jump List contains a collection of items interacted with (up to ~2000 items per application) - Each entry is represented as a LNK shell item providing additional data - Target Timestamps - File Size - Local Drive | Removable Media | Network Share Info - Entries kept in MRU order including a timestamp for each item Location: - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\AutomaticDestinations - %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\CustomDestinations # Shell Bags: Which folders were accessed on the local machine, network or removable device. Explorer access: USRCLASS.DAT Desktop Access: NTUSER.DAT Interpretation: - Massive collection of data on folders accessed by each user - Folder file system timestamps are archived in addition to first and last interaction times - “Exotic” items recorded like mobile device info, control panel access, and Zip archive acces Location: Primary Data - USRCLASS.DAT\\Local Settings\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\Bags - USRCLASS.DAT\\Local Settings\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\BagMRU Residual Desktop Items and Network Shares - NTUSER.DAT\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\BagMRU - NTUSER.DAT\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\Bags # Shortcut Files (LNK) Shortcut files created for: Shortcut files are automatically created by Windows, tracking files and folders opened by a user Interpretation: - Date/Time file of that name was first opened - Creation Date of Shortcut (LNK) File - Date/Time file of that name was last opened - Last Modification Date of Shortcut (LNK) File - LNK Target File (Internal LNK File Information) Data - Modified, Access, and Creation times of the target file - Volume Information (Name, Type, Serial Number) - Network Share information - Original Location - Name of System Location: - Win7+: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\ - Win7+: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\ # IE|Edge file:// Internet Explorer History databases have long held information on local and remote file access (via network shares), giving us an excellent means for determining files accessed on the system, per user. Information can be present even on Win11+ systems missing the Internet Explorer application. Not just related to internet browsing but also stores local, removable and remote (via network shares) file access. Interpretation: - Entries recorded as: file:///C:/directory/filename.ext - Does not mean file was opened in a browse Location: - IE10–11 &amp; Win10+: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\\WebCacheV*.dat # Office Recent Files MS Office apps will track their own recent file Location: NTUSER.DAT # MS Word Reading Locations Starting with Word 2013, the last known position of the user within a Word document is recorded. Interpretation: - Another source tracking recent documents opened - The last closed time is also tracked along with the last position within the file - Together with the last opened date in the Office File MRU key, a last session duration can be determined Location: NTUSER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\&lt;Version&gt;\\Word\\Reading Location . ### Windows Evidence of Application Execution . # Shimcache The Windows Application Compatibility Database is used by Windows to identify possible application compatibility challenges with executables. It tracks the executable file path and binary last modified time. Interpretation: Any executable present in the file system could be found in this key. Data can be particularly useful to identify the presence of malware on devices where other application execution data is missing (such as Windows servers). - Full path of executable - Windows 7+ contains up to 1,024 entries (96 entries in WinXP) - Post-WinXP no execution time is available - Executables can be preemptively added to the database prior to execution. - The existence of an executable in this key does not prove actual execution. Location: - Win7+: SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\AppCompatCach # Windows 10 Timeline Win10 records recently used applications and files in a “timeline” database in SQLite format. Interpretation: - Full path of executed application - Start time, end time, and duration - Items opened within application - URLs visited - Databases still present even after feature deprecation in late-Win10 Location: - C:\\Users\\&lt;profile&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\\&lt;account-ID&gt;\\ActivitiesCache.db # Task Bar Feature Usage Tracks how a user has interacted with the taskbar. Interpretation: - Only tracks GUI applications - Does not include timestamps - AppLaunch tracks data only for pinned applications, showing user knowledge of the application - Data persists after an application is unpinned - AppSwitched tracks a count of application focus, showing user interaction directed at the application - Not tied to pinned applications Location: - Win 10 1903+: NTUSER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\FeatureUsage # Prefetch Designed to speed up applications’ startup processes. File names consist of two parts: an executable name, and an eight-character hash of the executable’s location. Prefetch files contain various metadata: executable name, run count, volume information, files and directories referenced by the executable, and of course, timestamps. Interpretation: - file’s creation timestamp as the timestamp of the first execution. - embedded timestamp of the last execution - since version 26 (Windows 8.1), the 7 most recent last run times.
